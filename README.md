# ðŸš€ Background
Before diving into SAA-C03, I had some prior experience with cloud platforms. I had already completed:

AWS Cloud Practitioner

Azure Fundamentals

Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer

This background definitely helped me understand the core concepts more quickly, especially around compute, networking, and storage.

# ðŸŽ“ Course I Used

For learning, I used Stephane Maarekâ€™s SAA-C03 course.

The content was easy to follow and explained in a practical way.

It covered all the key services that appear on the exam.

The hands-on labs were especially helpful in reinforcing what I was learning.

I mostly stuck to this course throughout my preparation, and it turned out to be enough for building a strong foundation.

# ðŸ§ª Practice Tests I Took

Once I completed the course, I focused on [SAA-C03 practice questions](https://tinyurl.com/4aywvaxd) to test my understanding and get used to the exam format.

For that, I used Certifiedumps. The question sets I used from there felt close to the actual examâ€”not just in content but in the way questions were worded. Reviewing the explanations really helped me understand where I went wrong and why the correct answers were right.

I went through multiple practice sessions and focused more on the areas where I was scoring low. This helped me improve a lot in the final stretch of my preparation.

# ðŸ’¡ Final Thoughts

If youâ€™re planning to take the SAA-C03 exam, Iâ€™d recommend:

Getting hands-on with AWS, especially with services like EC2, S3, IAM, and VPC.

Breaking your study plan into small chunks and being consistent.

Using practice questions not just to test yourself, but to learn from them.

Everyoneâ€™s path is different, but this approach worked well for me. Feel free to reach out if you have any questionsâ€”Iâ€™d be happy to share more!
